 # React Dapp with Hardhat and MetaMask

## Overview
This repository contains a walkthrough for building a minimal React dApp interacting with a simple Solidity smart contract. It uses Hardhat and MetaMask.

## Audience
Developers, especially those in Ethereum Developer Bootcamps, will find this tutorial helpful. Basic familiarity with command-line terminals, Node.js, GitHub, and git CLI tools is assumed.

## Prerequisites and Disclaimer
Ensure you have a basic understanding of the tools involved. This tutorial is for educational purposes only; no real money or live blockchain networks are involved. Consider using separate browsers for development and live deployments.

## Motivation
Many existing "Build a Dapp" articles miss covering modern DeFi project workflows. This tutorial integrates contemporary tools to fill that gap, helping developers bridge theory and practice.

## Educational Focus
The tutorial prioritizes practical insights into DeFi workflows. Safety is crucial when transitioning to live networks; thorough research on blockchain security is recommended.


   **This article will specifically use the following technologies all together: **

- Hardhat
- MetaMask
- ethers.js
- React
- Typescript
- The web3-react npm package


## Tools You Will Use
- *Hardhat: Facilitates local Ethereum development, smart contract coding, testing, and debugging without live Ethereum blockchain interactions.*
- *MetaMask: Ethereum-based cryptocurrency wallet browser extension for interaction with Ethereum networks.*
- *Other Tools: git CLI for code retrieval, node and yarn for smart contract and frontend Dapp build, compile, and run tasks, and Terminal window for CLI tool usage*


## Tools & Setup

### CLI Tools & Hardhat

To get started, make sure you have the necessary tools installed and obtain the example code. You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## first we have to creat a directtory where we will isntal tihis thinks (tools)
```
mkdir <anyname>
```
*i created here <rl>*

#### 1. Node.js Installation

Follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js. For this tutorial, ensure you install version 16.13.1 of Node.js.

#### 2. Verify Installation

After installing Node.js, open a terminal and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 3 . CLI Tools & Hardhat

To get started, make sure you have the necessary tools installed and obtain the example code. You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system then we hato to do this :--.
 -  *here we have some command's to to install and setup the hardaht ::::‚¨áÔ∏è
  - 
Here are the installation and setup commands for Hardhat:

Installation:
Install Hardhat globally using npm:
```
npm install -g hardhat
```
Project Initialization:
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
Initialize a new Hardhat project:
```
npx hardhat
```

## Follow the prompts to select a project type and configure your project.
   ## Hardhat Configuration:

Customize your Hardhat configuration by editing the hardhat.config.js file generated in your project directory.
Configure networks, plugins, and other settings as needed for your project.

Install Dependencies (if using TypeScript or other plugins):
If you're using TypeScript or other plugins, install necessary dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/h
```
 - then you will be able to see the node moduls are creted:---

- **Here's a brief explanation of the node_modules directory:**

  Purpose: It holds all the dependencies (like Hardhat and its plugins) required by your project.
  Contents: Each dependency is stored in its own subdirectory.
  Management: Dependencies are installed and managed using npm or yarn.
  Versioning: Specific versions of dependencies are specified in your project's package.json file.
  Ignored: Typically excluded from version control to avoid unnecessary duplication.
  Installation: Run npm install or yarn install to download and install dependencies.
  Updating: Modify versions in package.json, then re-run installation to update dependencies.


### 4. Yarn Installation
- Once Node.js is installed, you'll also need to install Yarn, a package manager. Follow the instructions [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) to install Yarn.
- With these tools installed, you're ready to proceed with setting up your environment for building the React Dapp with Hardhat and MetaMask.
- This markdown formatting is suitable for a GitHub README.md file, providing clear instructions for setting up the development environment.

  ```
  yarn -version
  ```
### 5. Git Installation
Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Follow the instructions [here](qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-machine-learning/tutorials/01_neural_networks.html) to install Git on your system.
With these tools installed, you're ready to proceed with setting up your environment for building the React Dapp with Hardhat and MetaMask.


##:_ Now move on with our main object :--:_üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
   *here wil creat a another directory inside the previous dirctory where we have instanlled all those tools :--:_(do it carefully)üò•
   ``
  mkdir <hardhat-ethers-react-ts-starter>
   ``

  - *after this you have to clone a github repo*:--üï∂Ô∏è
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ChainShot/hardhat-ethers-react-ts-starter.git
    ```

   - *then after this u will see some files are created there in ur folder :--
